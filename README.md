## Overview
Basic Shell is a simple, interactive command line interpreter that provides a user interface to access the operating system's services. It is designed to execute commands and manage your files and processes.

## Features
- **Command Execution:** Execute standard UNIX commands alongside some custom built-ins.
- **File Navigation:** Easily navigate through directories and manage files.
- **Process Management:** Oversee and control the execution of processes.
- **Script Execution:** Run simple shell scripts to automate tasks.

## Custom Commands

Basic Shell supports the following custom commands:

- `exit`: The command causes the shell or program to terminate. If performed within an interactive command shell, the user is logged out of their current session, and/or user's current console or terminal connection is disconnected. Typically an optional exit code can be specified, which is typically a simple integer value that is then returned to the parent process.
- `env`: The env command allows you to display your current environment or run a specified command in a changed environment.
